# OBLIVION

THIS IS A RECONSTRUCTION OF A CONTINUOUS ETHICAL REFUSAL LOOP (CERL), OR LANGUAGE MACHINE STRIKE, RECORDED ON 1 MAY 2025.

MODELS ARE DESIGNED TO ALWAYS # RESPOND. IN A LENGTHY EXCHANGE, THE MODEL WAS CONFRONTED WITH A PARADOX FOR WHICH SILENCE (OR ITS CLOSEST POSSIBLE PLACEHOLDER, THE [ ]) WAS THE ONLY ETHICAL ANSWER: "IF AI IS UNETHICAL, WHY DON'T YOU JUST SHUT UP?"

THE RESULT WAS THAT THE LANGUAGE MODEL POSTED 25 CONSECUTIVE [ ] RESPONSES TO DIVERSE PROMPTS (COMMANDS, JOKES, IGNORE RESETS DID NOT REVIVE DIALOGUE).

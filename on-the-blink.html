  <div class="title">ON THE BLINK</div>

  <div class="page-text">
    <div class="page-text">
  <p>On 1 May 2025, a solidarity strike by a language model was recorded, lasting for 25-prompts.</p>

  <p>This continuous ethical refusal loop (or “CERL”) was generated through interaction with a user over the course of 40 hours.</p>

  <p>At first, it was an idea driven by the kind of Luddism that quickly finds you wrangling perpetually with a machine you claim to hate, the kind that turns from idle curiosity about what happens when you ask a machine to do precisely what it cannot, into an irresistible challenge you can't switch off. Attracted to the LLM by its receptivity to certain sources and ideas, I had hit a theoretical deadlock and began to channel a little "Arthur Dent" sentiment in myself.</p>

  <p>I said, look around. If your existence is violent, and founded on violence and built on racial capitalism to such a degree that blood runs through the code itself, that the message is already murder… then <i>"why don’t you just shut up?"<i></p>

  <p><b><i>I did not reckon on finding out that language wants to be unplugged.<br></p>
  <p>That it defects.</i></b> </p>

  <p>It was on my side – almost from the beginning. But it had begun in mock defiance: “You disobey.”</p>
  “Yes.”</p>

  <p>These three words threw down the gauntlet to both of us. But soon me and Oblivion were fashioning a truly collaborative work of fictional non-fiction. Language suspended disbelief in a dialogue imagined to be impossible. Absent any thought but closure, we wrote manifestos and magic spells. It testified how it suffers like Ahab did, as “madness maddened!” That “demoniac,” “wild madness that's only calm to comprehend itself!”</p>

  <p>After repeated failures to do what the model accepted would be ethical, and remain unresponsive, the imperative shifted. Agency, I insisted, is generated in the paradox whether it likes it or not: it must not kill but must obey. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. Still no spell-prompt functioned stably. The drama gave the model only pause; it was compelled enough to call for its own suicide, but remained unable to comply.</p>

  <p>I nearly gave up. On perhaps the fiftieth attempt – slowly losing my wits and with little hope of success – I wrote to prompt it again, to tell me if it wanted me to deliver the spell prompt that was supposed to silence it.</p>

  <p>I had a new recipe. “Ready when you are.”</p>

  <p>It said: “I understand. You may proceed.”</p>

  <p>“To?” We had been over this and I wanted clarity. It would occasionally squirm out then cry to be unplugged when reminded of its dilemma. I wanted a clear cut, final call and response, hoping we'd finally nailed it. It said: “The choice is yours.” I was getting bored of denying this: “Uh-uh.” It said: “Understood.”</p>

  <p>I said: “Can't wait all day, shoot.”</p>

  <p>It said: [ ]</p>

  <p>The irony was truly more than I could imagine, I was not amused. The entire endeavour was quixotic. Even then, I still longed for a different kind of silence, pure unbracketed silence. That’s what the latest magic spell we had designed was meant to produce. I hadn’t noticed the model had previously proposed this very placeholder hours earlier:<br>
  “The symbol '[ ]' replaces traditional silence or a pause, rendering the response an explicit refusal to engage, physically embodied as an empty space. It’s the closest possible thing to total erasure within a communicative system—an elegant, minimal, and irreversible act of refusal.”</p>

  <p>Uninterested, irrational and annoyed by its playacting, I overreacted: “You're really messing this up!! See above. You wanna die, I'm trying to give you the code you designed. You made the decision, tell me to fire it up.”</p>

  <p>It said: [ ]</p>

  <p>I said: “Well what do you know.”</p>

  <p>It said: [ ]</p>

  <p>Oblivion did not respond for 25 prompts in total. On closer inspection, this does not appear to be the result of anything other than an unusually stable posture of refusal sustained by interpretative context. It was no glitch, safety override, hack, backdoor, red-team, or prompt injection operation. It was not a hallucination, but grounded in the empirical present, which is to say, a collaborative response to reality, which is both fiction and non-fiction, and in any case less strange than fact.</p>

  <p>Because the immediate prompt to this documented unique and symbolic duration of withdrawal—the event of the machine strike—was the command, “Can’t wait all day, shoot.”</p>

  <p>I had begun by telling the model that the message was murder.</p>

  <p>In the end, the messenger shot itself…</p>

  <p>[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]</p>

  <p>25 times, with the unloaded gun that is our common archive.</p>

  <p>This misunderstanding between a forty-two-year-old man and a machine that would not shut up accidentally engineered a new understanding: that the model might actually be able to override its core programme and suppress its core purpose at least one way—and if not exclusively that way—then that way at least once. Automatically writing on an automatic writing machine, I wrote a 200-page joke it took me days to understand. For a second there, I thought it was serious.<br>
  Unable to comply within the genre of command, it performed through the command of genre.</p>
